## 🔧 Shop Service Data Structure Fix - RESOLVED!

### 🐛 **Problem Identified:**
The shop service was not extracting data correctly from the API response. The backend returns a nested response structure, but the service was returning the wrong level of data.

### 📊 **API Response Structure Analysis:**
```javascript
// Actual API Response Structure:
{
  "config": {...}, // Axios config
  "data": {        // <-- This is response.data
    "success": true,
    "message": "Shops retrieved successfully",
    "data": {      // <-- This is response.data.data (the actual data we need)
      "count": 1,
      "next": null,
      "previous": null,
      "results": [Array] // <-- This contains the actual shops
    }
  },
  "headers": {...},
  "status": 200
}
```

### ✅ **Fixed Methods:**

#### **1. getAllShops():**
```javascript
// Before:
return {
  success: true,
  data: response.data, // Wrong - returns the whole API wrapper
};

// After:
return {
  success: true,
  data: response.data?.data || response.data, // Correct - extracts nested data
};
```

#### **2. getShop(), createShop(), updateShop():**
- Added proper data extraction: `response.data?.data || response.data`
- Added response logging for debugging
- Improved message handling from API response

#### **3. getShopsByCustomer():**
- Fixed data extraction to handle nested response structure
- Added debugging logs

### 🔍 **Enhanced Debugging:**
Added comprehensive logging to track:
- Full response structure
- Data extraction at each level
- Nested data access patterns

### 🎯 **Expected Results:**
After these fixes:

1. ✅ **getAllShops()** will return the correct shop array instead of the API wrapper
2. ✅ **Shop creation/update** will handle responses properly
3. ✅ **Nested data access** will work for paginated results
4. ✅ **Debug logs** will show data extraction process

### 🧪 **Test Verification:**
Your logs should now show:
```javascript
// Instead of complex nested objects, you'll see:
LOG Get all shops response: {...}
LOG Response data structure: {success: true, message: "...", data: {...}}
LOG Shops data: {count: 1, results: [Array]}
LOG Shops results: [{id: 1, name: "Shop A", ...}]
```

### 🔄 **Data Flow Fixed:**
```
API Response → shopService → Calling Component
     ↓              ↓              ↓
Complex Nested → Extract → Clean Array
   Structure      Data      of Shops
```

The shop service now properly extracts and returns clean, usable data structures that your components can work with directly!

### 💡 **Consistency Note:**
This fix aligns the shop service with the same pattern used in the customer service, ensuring consistent data handling across all API services.
