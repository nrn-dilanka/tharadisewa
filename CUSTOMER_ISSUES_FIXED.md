## ✅ Customer Issues Fixed - RESOLVED!

### 🐛 **Issues Addressed:**

#### **1. API Error: `user_info` field issue**
- **Problem**: `Field name 'user_info' is not valid for model 'Customer'`
- **Cause**: `CustomerListSerializer` had `user_info` in fields but no corresponding SerializerMethodField
- **Solution**: ✅ Removed `user_info` from `CustomerListSerializer` fields list
- **Status**: **FIXED** - API now works without errors

#### **2. Remove Date of Birth Field**
- **Request**: Remove `date_of_birth` from customer model and all related code
- **Changes Made**:
  - ✅ **Backend Model**: Removed `date_of_birth` field from `Customer` model
  - ✅ **Database Migration**: Created and applied migration to remove column
  - ✅ **Serializers**: Removed `date_of_birth` from all customer serializers
  - ✅ **Frontend Form**: Removed date of birth field from `CreateCustomerScreen`
  - ✅ **Validation**: Removed date of birth validation logic
- **Status**: **COMPLETED** - Field completely removed from system

### 🔧 **Technical Details:**

```

#### **Frontend Changes:**
